I am a third year graduate student at UC Davis studying cognitive development in Dr. Lisa Oakes’ Infant Cognition Lab at the Center for Mind and Brain. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a BS in Psychology in 2014.

My research interests are largely centered on the development of visual attention and longitudinal methods. Specifically, I’m interested in how different contexts and experiences influence cognitive development and how researchers can best tease apart and measure factors that shape the infant’s developing mind.
